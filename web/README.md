# Getting Started

This project is using the frontend build tool [Vite](https://vite.dev/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically patch changes in if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm lint`

Runs eslint in favour of a cleaner code style.

### `npm test`

Launches the Vitest test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the [Vitest documentation](https://vitest.dev/) for further information.

### `npm run build`

The build runs `eslint` and typechecks with `tsc` first.
On successful checks, it builds the optimized app for production to the `dist` folder.\

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
