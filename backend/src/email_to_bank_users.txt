Thank you for your interest in Reboot!

We'd love to take this opportunity to give you more information about how to get
started.

Reboot is in Alpha, which means that you may encounter bugs and rough edges.
If you see something you think is wrong, have questions about how to do
something, or if you want to give feedback (whether constructive or positive),
please drop in on our Discord server https://discord.gg/cRbdcS94Nr - we'd love
to hear from you!

To get started with Reboot, we suggest you look at our Quick Start page
https://docs.reboot.dev/, which will get you started with
editing an example application, and explain how to run it locally on your own
machine or on cloud workstations like a GitHub Codespace.

Start Building! https://docs.reboot.dev/

We're looking forward to seeing what you build!

- The Reboot Team.
